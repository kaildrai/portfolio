        I am a recently graduated Computer Scientist with a major in Systems Administration looking for full-time work. 
        I have achieved excellent results during my time at university, currently having a 5.1 GPA.<br></br><br></br>
        The knowledge and skillset I have attained while studying at university, working on passion projects and a combined 9 years in the workforce has taught me how to conduct myself in professional team environments as well as work autonomously with little supervision while achieving high results.<br></br><br></br> 
        I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about myself and my fit for this position.</p>
