        I am a recently graduated Computer Scientist with a major in Systems
        Administration looking for full-time work. I have achieved excellent
        results during my time at university, currently having a 5.1 GPA.

        The knowledge and skillset I have attained while studying at university,
        working on passion projects and a combined 9 years in the workforce has
        taught me how to conduct myself in professional team environments as
